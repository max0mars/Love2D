Things to add:
- different types of enemies
- defense turrets
- upgrade/research tree (better robot stats, more miners, etc.)


Maybe make table holding defense bots/enemy bots generic so can add other things like structures or different types of entities
- might have to adjust the x,y of structures and other things
